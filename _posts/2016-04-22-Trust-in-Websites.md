In Wednesday's lesson (2/12/15) we were talking about trust in websites. We also discussed how Wikipedia is a good site which is monitored. BBC is good but sometimes like wikipedia does not include some information and sometimes is wrong. Unlike social media BBC are sometimes very biased and don't always show the truth.
