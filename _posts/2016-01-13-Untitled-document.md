In today's lesson we were talking/thinking about advertising and media. Media is a big part of modern day life and most of us get it in some shape, way or form multiple times a day. At first the message gets 'briefed' over our heads but later we analyse it and realize what it mean. The good, and the bad. The mediaâ€™s creators don't usually want you to know the bad but unless you analyse it even deeper, most people don't see the bad.

And lastly Mr Keen helped me with my blog and now FINALLY I have colour!
