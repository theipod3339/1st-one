With the identity map I first got all of my pictures then printed, cut and then positioned and glued them down all on the day it was set. Then the next day I wrote all of the info while regularly checking back to make sure I included everything that I needed (And I **did** have everything.) The next afternoon I showed it to my family then got some feedback on how to improve which I also did. 

I was very excited showing it to the class as I had (in my opinion) done a really good job on it which I was proud of.

Judging by everyone else's, mine was one of the better ones which was a bit of a relief and it was fun giving feedback but I made myself say (if) what was bad and why.

This layout was easier and more fun showing/presenting this work as @ the end we got a physical thing to represent us.

I was very relieved to see the feedback but I wasn't surprised by the positive comments made and with the constructive criticism I took it on-board and will use/do it next time.

Online there is no saying that someone is someone but here you know it's them and that what you see is true.

The identity map did not create a sense of what I want t be when i'm older as i already knew.

There aren't any changes that I want to make using media based on this (mini) project/topic.

These six weeks did not change my perception of media in any way.

The 6 lessons didn'ts change how i plan to use media/social media in the future.
